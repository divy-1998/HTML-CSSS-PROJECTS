            <p> With the idea of imparting programming knowledge, Mr. Sandeep Jain, an IIT Roorkee alumnus started a dream, GeeksforGeeks. Whether programming
                excites you or you feel stifled, wondering how to prepare for interview questions or
                how to ace data structures and algorithms, GeeksforGeeks is a one-stop solution. With every
                tick of time, we are adding arrows in our quiver. From articles on various computer science subjects to programming problems for practice,
                from basic to premium courses, from technologies to entrance examinations, we have been building ample content
                with superior quality. In a short span, we have built a community of 1 Million+ Geeks around the world, 20,000+
                Contributors and 500+ Campus Ambassadors in various colleges across the nation. Our success stories include a lot of
                students who benefitted in their placements and landed jobs at tech giants. Our vision is to build a gigantic
                network of geeks and we are only a fraction of it yet.
